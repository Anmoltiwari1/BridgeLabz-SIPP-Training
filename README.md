# 🧩 BridgeLabz SIPP Training – Core Java

A collection of Java programs created during the **BridgeLabz SIPP (Ship Intelligence & Programming Program)**, covering a wide range of foundational concepts from control flow and data structures to simulations and utilities.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Organized thematically, each directory contains Java source files related to its concept:

- **Built-In**: Demonstrations of built-in Java classes and utilities  
- **ControlFlow**: Programs illustrating branching, loops, and decision-making  
- **Day1_ProgrammingElements**: Core syntax and basic constructs  
- **Java Array**: Array manipulations and operations  
- **JavaStrings**: String processing and algorithms

Each theme includes descriptive examples demonstrating common Java workflows and logic.

## 📌 Highlights by Theme

### 🧠 Built-In
- Showcases commonly used Java classes (e.g. `Math`, `Scanner`, `LocalDateTime`, etc.)
- Utilities for input handling, math operations, and date-time management

### 🔄 Control Flow
- If-else, switch statements, and loop constructs
- Examples: number classification, menu-driven interfaces, pattern printing

### 🗓 Day1 – Programming Basics
- Variable declarations, operators, basic input/output
- Introductory exercises on arithmetic and simple user interaction

### 🔢 Java Array
- 1D and 2D array algorithms: reversal, searching, sorting, matrix conversion
- Practical exercises: splitting odds/evens, mean calculations, vote eligibility

### ✍️ Java Strings
